| This presentation was about the research of the granite in Medicine Park at the Wichita Mountains, comparing it to the rest of the granite in the Wichita Mountains (referred to as the Wichita Granite Group, or WGG. Jordan Swearingen hopes to learn why the granite in Medicine Park is so much different from the granite in the rest of the WGG. |
